{"name":"VideoEditor","body":"# What is it?\r\nA full-featured simple video editor for the Nokia N9 (Harmattan Meego platform) written using C++/Qt/QML and leveraging [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) and GStreamer Editing Services for the heavy lifting in the background. It is licensed under LGPL v2.1 or later.\r\n\r\n# What can I do with it?\r\n* Add/remove clips to a timeline\r\n* Select an individual clip to interact with it\r\n  * Drag and drop to reorder\r\n  * Drag the start/end point to trim\r\n* Seek within the timeline\r\n* Preview the composition\r\n* Configure export settings\r\n* Export to a new file\r\n\r\n# When and why?\r\nAs the Harmattan Meego project was winding down, developers working on the platform had some spare time during March 2012 that could be put to good use. While the platform already has a very simple video editor, it is limited to opening a single video file and trimming the start/end points. We, Robert Swain (@superdump) and Thiago Santos (@thiagoss), wanted to do something more and had about a month in which to do it.\r\n\r\n# What else?\r\nRobert had never done any UI development before. Both of us had been working on GStreamer in the middleware of the platform, so had experience with it. The QML ListView element is both your friend and your enemy for doing stuff like this. GStreamer and its supporting libraries really do make developing multimedia apps stupidly easy. Robert and Thiago will bear the maintenance burden, along with anyone else who wishes to contribute. Yey, FOSS! \\o/\r\n\r\n# What do we think about it?\r\nWe hope you like it. It should be landing on Ovi Store real soon now for the rather steep price of nothing. We think it's more than worth it. ;)","tagline":"Nokia N9 Video Editor","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
